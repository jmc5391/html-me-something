                    <h2>Freddie Mercury</h2>
                    <p>Frederick "Freddie" Mercury is a one year old Black Lab/Bassett Hound/Shephard mix. He is a very playful dog with tons of energy. His hobbies include burping, chewing up toys (and everything else), and barking at loud noises.
                        Freddie is a rescue whose mom was being kept against their lease in an apartment. When she got pregnant, the landlord found out and told the owner to put the dogs down or find them another home.
                        Freddie's mom and three sisters were surrendered to Animal Rescue Services, who my girlfriend Alex and I worked with at the PetSmart in Manchester, Missouri. We met Fred, immediately fell in love and took him home the same day.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Isabella Petunia</h2>
                    <p>Isabella, or Izzy, is a one year old American Eskimo/Toy Poodle mix. She loves people and wants nothing more than to be pet and cuddled with. Whenever she meets new people, she yelps and whines while wagging her whole body until they give her some scratches.
                        Izzy loves her brother Freddie and follows him around everwhere he goes. They play constantly and sometimes fight over toys, but they love each other and never leave each other out of sight.
                        We met Izzy at Petland. My girlfriend Alex really wanted a cat, so we were going around pet stores and animal shelters looking at kitties when we met her and we had to take her home with us.

                        <h2>Tinker, Bell and Mini Pig</h2>
                        <p>Tinker, better known as Tink, is a sassy, fat guinea pig who is a little over 1 year old. Her favorite activity is screaming until we give her carrots. 
                            We got her because she looks very different from other guinea pigs. She has all black sheep-like fur except for one spot of white
                             fur on the back of her neck. She used to be sweet until she found a new love for food. </p>
                        <p>Bell is a very sweet, gentle guinea pig who happens to be from the same litter as Tink even though they look nothing alike. B
                            ell is a little skiddish, but she has never been aggressive towards anyone in her life. She loves carrots and red leaf lettuce. 
                            Even though she is a sweet guinea pig, she tends to scare people with her big, red eyes. </p>
                        <p>Mini pig is a tiny, 3 month old guinea pig, but don't let that fool you. She is so loud, you can hear her from outside of the house. 
                            She is a very vocal guinea pig even when she doesn't want anything, she just wants to be included in conversations. Her mom and dad 
                            were an owner surrounder to the Petco where my girlfriend works. The owner swore up and down that they had never been housed together,
                             so there was no way that the female guinea pig could be pregnant. Well, just a couple weeks later, she gave birth to two babies. 
                             My girlfriend brought home one and the rest is history. We originally named Mini Pig Darla, and Mini Pig was just supposed 
                             to be a nickname, but Mini Pig just fit her personality better.</p>

                            <h4>The Shih Tzus</h4>
                            <p>My parents have six shih tzus. Yeah.</p>
                            <h5>Junko, the Mama</h5>
                            <p>The smartest of the group, Junko, aka Juney, is around 14 years old. She's the mother of Turner, Hooch, George and May. She is a very
                                cuddly and friendly dog.</p>
                            <h5>Lennon-Harrison, the Uncle</h5>
                            <p>Better known as Lenny. The only black and white shih tzu of the group, Lenny is very sweet and gentle. He helped raise the puppies.</p>
                            <h5>Turner, the Glutton</h5>
                            <p>Turner, the first born. The biggest of the four puppies and the biggest eater. He lives for food.</p>
                            <h5>Hooch, the Odd One</h5>
                            <p>Hooch, like Turner, was named after the fantastic Tom Hanks movie. He is a very strange dog and makes indescribable noises. Very playful.</p>
                            <h5>George, the Cuddle Monster</h5>
                            <p>Loves to be the center of attention, George will cuddle you for as long as you let him. George never got along well with the other dogs. Would do well as an old lady's dog.</p>
                            <h5>May, the Mean One</h5>
                            <p>May is very tall, very skinny and very fierce. She is sweet to people but like any woman who grew up with lots of brothers, has a strong personality.</p>
