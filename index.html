                    <h2>Freddie Mercury</h2>
                    <p>Frederic "Freddie" Mercury is a one year old Black Lab/Bassett Hound/Shephard mix. He is a very playful dog with tons of energy. His hobbies include burping, chewing up toys (and everything else), and barking at loud noises.
                        Freddie is a rescue whose mom was being kept against their lease in an apartment. When she got pregnant, the landlord found out and told the owner to put the dogs down or find them another home.
                        Freddie's mom and three sisters were surrendered to Animal Rescue Services, who my girlfriend Alex and I worked with at the PetSmart in Manchester, Missouri. We met Fred, immediately fell in love and took him home the same day.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Isabella Petunia</h2>
                    <p>Isabella, or Izzy, is a one year old American Eskimo/Toy Poodle mix. She loves people and wants nothing more than to be pet and cuddled with. Whenever she meets new people, she yelps and whines while wagging her whole body until they give her some scratches.
                        Izzy loves her brother Freddie and follows him around everwhere he goes. They play constantly and sometimes fight over toys, but they love each other and never leave each other out of sight.
                        We met Izzy at Petland. My girlfriend Alex really wanted a cat, so we were going around pet stores and animal shelters looking at kitties when we met her and we had to take her home with us.
